In order to wiin this game you need to collect the sword item and the key item. The sword is located in the most southern region of the game. 
The key can be seen within starting the game. A Ghini(ghost) enemy will be following you throughout the game. Every time it touches you, you lose some health. Be sure to avoid it at all costs.
There's also an extra heart nearby to showcase the addition of player health.
