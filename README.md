# LOZClone
Building off of my previous works with ASCII dungeon and Frat Party, I decided to fuse the code of those two together to make an entire clone of Legend of Zelda (NES).

All sprite assests,sound effects ,and other assests all go to their original creators. I did not create any art or music for this game. The only thing I created was the code for this project. This is a fanmade project and if the original owners have an issue with this being public please contact me @ brentonfiguresmormon@gmail.com so I can take down the project.
